			After years of part time gaming, Matthew Bailey made his debut on Twitch and YouTube, streaming and posting content for his fast growing audiences. Still new to this wannabe professional gamer? Look no further than the Official Matthew Bailey website! (Trademark Pending). What is really 'crazy' about this guy is the origins of the name... look no further than back in his middle school years of his life. He played a game called Grand Theft Auto 5: Online, and was quite good despite his younger age, and so he was often invited to join with people he did not know. This led him to be ridiculed for the name that was given to his account once he made it: MochaMinataur87. After one night of being joked on about his name and why he hadn't changed it, he made a joke that led one of the older people in the game chat to call him a 'crazy guy', to which he exclaimed 'No, I am not a crazy guy'. With the realization hitting him that he just found his name, he hurried to find if any iteration of the two words "crazy" and "guy" had been claimed before; and lucky for him, a name with no letters or numbers was found: NotACrazyGuy. And so this name has stuck with Matthew Bailey throughout his many years of gaming, and you can find him on any platform that he is on, going by his name of NotACrazyGuy, even to this day.
